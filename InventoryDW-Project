<h3>1. Inventory Transaction Cycles </h3>
<p>Inventory that is bought, sold, consumed, and produced is the heart of any manufacturing and/or distribution company.  Inventory transactions are frequent and commonplace.  The volume and significance of inventory transactions make them important in a data warehouse design.
Because inventory management is a common and important yet difficult activity in many organizations, ERP vendors have 
developed Enterprise Resource Management (ERP) software to provide software support. Typically, ERP software provides 
modules related to Manufacturing, Distribution/Logistics, Financials, and HR/Payroll.  Inventory is at the heart of the 
Manufacturing and Distribution/Logistics modules.  The work order, sales, and purchase life cycles affect the perpetual 
inventory balance as shown in Figure 1. In addition, inventory transactions including adjustments, transfers, issues, and 
reclassifications affect the perpetual inventory balance. </p>
